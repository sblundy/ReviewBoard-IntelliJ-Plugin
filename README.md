IntelliJ Client Plugin for ReviewBoard
=============
The point of this plugin is to ease interacting with a ReviewBoard server from the IntelliJ IDE. At the moment, all it
does is allow for the creation of a draft review request from the Changes tool window. Meaning that you can skip the
patch creation step. Future enhancements include directly viewing the diffs associated with incoming reviews. It is not
intended to be a full replacement for the web-ui. Rather it will simplify using IntelliJ for what it does best: viewing
code.
